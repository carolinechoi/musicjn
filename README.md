# Music JN

An app that uses the Google Cloud Vision API and Universal Music Group API to suggests playlists to the User. The User will take a photo of the setting and a Firebase Database will store the image, labeling and defining certain emotions or objects. It will then push a playlist with suggested songs.

Created under 24 hours at the 2018 Outside Hacks, the official Outside Lands Hackathon, sponsored by Universal Music Group and Twitch.

**Note:** 
This app was created with APIs provided by Universal Music Group under specific circumstance and therefore cannot be recreated without explicit permission from UMG.
