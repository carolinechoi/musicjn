# Music JN

An app that uses the Google Cloud Vision API and Universal Music Group API to suggests playlists to the User. The User will take a photo of the setting and a Firebase Database will store the image after passing through Cloud Vision, labeling and defining certain emotions or objects. It will then push a playlist with suggested songs.

App is built on Ionic framework, v. 3.

Created under 24 hours at the 2018 Outside Hacks, the official Outside Lands Hackathon, sponsored by Universal Music Group and Twitch.

This app was created with APIs provided by Universal Music Group under specific circumstances and therefore cannot be recreated without explicit permission from UMG.
